This directory contains all the standard frames that
will be recognized by our DM. 

Note that in addition to the slots specified, every
single event will have a WHEN slot to be filled,
since this is a calendar interface.

Each slot name is followed by one of the following tags:
WHO
WHAT
WHERE


Future work could avoid this hard coding by using
a knowledge base to determine a direct mapping
of the extracted elements of the NLU.
