	<!-- Example of a dialogue domain for a flight-booking system specified in 
	probabilistic rules. The system enables the user to book (single or round-trip)
	flight tickets between Norwegian airports.  The dialogue domain shows how to
	implement a basic slot-filling system. 
	
	The domain still remains quite rudimentary (e.g. there is currently no possibility 
	to fill several slots at once or  "backtrack" to change a previous slot), but it
	demonstrates how to specify all the parts of the dialogue system, from natural language
	understanding to dialogue management and generation.
